This JavaScript-based tool simplifies the task of calculating aspect ratios for various design and development applications. With added style from Google Fonts and a user-friendly interface, it's a handy resource for web developers and designers. Feel free to explore and use this calculator for your projects. The Aspect Ratio Calculator is a web-based tool designed to simplify the task of calculating aspect ratios for various design and development applications. This project, created as part of the 100 Days of JavaScript Coding Challenge, offers a user-friendly interface and valuable functionality.

HTML (index.html):
The HTML structure consists of a container with a title, input fields for aspect ratio values (width and height), and input fields for width and height. These elements are thoughtfully organized within div elements with specific classes for styling. The page includes references to external CSS and JavaScript files to enhance styling and functionality.

CSS (style.css):
The CSS file defines the overall styling of the web page. It imports the Google Fonts library for font styling and sets a dark cyan background color for the body. The container is styled with a white background, padding, border-radius, and box-shadow to create an appealing design. The fonts, colors, and input styles are customized to improve readability and aesthetics.

JavaScript (index.js):
The JavaScript code focuses on dynamically calculating width and height based on user input for aspect ratio. Two functions, calculateWidth and calculateHeight, are defined to perform these calculations. Event listeners are added to input fields to trigger these functions when the user enters values. The aspect ratio formula is applied to update the corresponding width or height value in real-time, providing a practical tool for designers and developers.

This Aspect Ratio Calculator project combines essential HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts to create a functional and visually appealing web application. It serves as a valuable resource for professionals working with aspect ratios in their projects.
